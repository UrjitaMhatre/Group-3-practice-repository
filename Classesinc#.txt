Types of classes in c#
=========================
1.Concrete class(default)
2.Static class//all members are static, it cannot be instaited and inherited
3.Sealed class//if don't want a particular class to inherit,sealed classes can be instantiated

4.Abstract
class is declare with abstract keyword.
It is an incomplete class.
it is a combination of abstract and non-abstract methods
abstract method is a method which does not have definition or body
abstract methos is declared using abstract keyword
syntax:
public abstract void M();
Abstract classes are inherited and not instantiated.
when abstract is inherited by derived class then drived class should implement all abstract methos of abstract class
while implementing abstract methods in derived class use override keyword
*if any class is base class we can use the object to instantiate the derived class
BaseClass obj=new DeirvedClass();

5.Partial
//Create multiple classes with same name in a project
partial class ClassName
6.Generic
